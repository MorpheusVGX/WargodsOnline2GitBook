# Training Points

As characters gain levels they also earn Training Points that are used to increase Stats. Each character has up to 5 (some classes only have 3) stats to train: Strength, Wisdom, Agility, Aura, and Speed. Players can decide which Stats to improve and neglect. Stats cost 1 Training point until 200. After 200, the cost increases to 2 points and doubles every 100. Hero Subscribers are able to reset their Skills to try different strategies as often as they like. However free users can only reset their Skills once per day.
