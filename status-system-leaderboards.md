# Status System (Leaderboards)

Continuing with the themes of player identity and community engagement, this system celebrates one character with a statue in each town. A new statue is placed in the town center every Sunday at midnight server time. Interactions with the statue will reveal the local leaderboard for that town and the global leaderboards. Statue points are rewarded for quest victories, arena wins, merchant purchases, and online time.
