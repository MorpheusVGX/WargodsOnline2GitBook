* Raider - Gladiator, Sorcerer, Ninja
* Defender - Guardian, Elemental, Archer
* Support - Mage, Cleric, WIzard
* Fighter - Paladin, Rogue, Stormcaller

**Leveling**

Max level of 50. Each level gives 6 Training Points that are used to increase Stats. Experience needed to proceed to the next level increase with the following formulas:

* Level x 2 (1-10)
* Level x 16 (11-25)
* Level x 32 (26-40)
* Level x 48 (41-50)
* Level x 128 (50)

After reaching level 50, players can continue to increase their levels for extra Training Points. This gives loyal players a tangible reward to continue playing at max level.
