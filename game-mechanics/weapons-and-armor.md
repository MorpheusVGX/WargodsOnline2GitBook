# Weapons and Armor

Weapons and Armor introduce another core game mechanic, Ore. Ore, which is earned through quest rewards and salvaging unwanted items, comes in 3 qualities: Raw, Refined, and Flaws. Ore from different regions (Olympus, Hades, Celestial, Ragnarok, and Avalon) also have varying special properties. Once Ore is added to Weapons and Armor, they can give Stat Boosts, Passive and Active Abilities, or Enchantments. However Ore is not permanent. Once infused into an item, ore will begin to decay and eventually lose its bonuses. Lower quality Raw ore will decay much faster than Flawless ore.



Each item is made from a pattern, template, and ore. Patterns are only cosmetic and can be changed at any time to items that fit the pattern type. Templates come with 1 to 4 slots to add ore. Ore can be added to a template if a slot of the same type of available.
