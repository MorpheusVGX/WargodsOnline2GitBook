At its core Wargods Online 2 is about character progression. As characters grow in level and strength, more options are available for customization and player identity. The Quest System is the main mechanic that rewards players with advancement.

Players are first introduced to the quest system from receiving a chest that contains drachmas and 3 Legend Cards. This gives them the ability to choose their first weapon and armor and set off on a mission. The first 3 Legend Cards provide a variety of quest types (Combat, Exploration, Arena), to appeal to different playstyles. At higher ranks, some Legend Cards present class specific challenges which makes it impossible for one character to complete the full set alone. This design requires teamwork and interactions with players with different classes and playstyle preferences. As players progress through the game completing Legend card challenges, they will be immersed into the gameâ€™s history and become valuable members of the game community.
