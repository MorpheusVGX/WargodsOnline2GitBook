# Core Game Play

Although the quest system is at the center of Wargods Online 2, the combat system is where playerâ€™s will ultimately earn their stripes. There are 3 available combat options: Quest, Arena (PvP), and Guild Training. In Quests, each victory is rewarded with experience and a chance of receiving a region specific chest. Arena victories are only rewarded with chests. Guild Training victories increase the Ability Reps needed to improve Guild Ability levels. Chests may contain weapons, armor, ore, legend cards, or drachmas.

The main gameplay loop presents the player with a selection of quest options (Combat, Adventure, Arena) with Legend Cards, surprise rewards on victory (Chests), and a selection of character advancement options (Stats, Abilities, Weapons, Armor).
