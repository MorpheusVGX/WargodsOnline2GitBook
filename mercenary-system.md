# Mercenary System

The Mercenary System is the game mechanic that adds the final layer of strategy and community to the game. Since battles can support up to 4 vs 4 combat, solo players will need 3 other characters with them to compete at the highest levels. To achieve this, players can choose to hire mercenaries from a list of active characters and NPCs. Mercenaries can be hired for a day, a month, or a lifetime each costing an increasing amount of drachmas. If a player’s character is hired by another player, they receive 10% of the fee. This mechanic gives players pride in their characters and allows a great character to have an impact on the community’s success. Characters start out with 5 mercenary slots and gain 5 every 10 levels for a maximum of 30 at level 50. Additional slots can be bought if more slots are needed.
