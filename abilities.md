# Abilities

In Wargods Online 2, there are 16 Guild Abilities, 15 Class Abilities, and 19 Ore Abilities. Each Ability has a unique effect and Action Point requirement. Starting off, character only have access to their classâ€™ base Abilities, but through question rewards and training, they will gain access to more options. Since a character can only have a maximum of 3 active Abilities (Class, Guild, Ore), players will be required to choose the abilities that are most effective for their play style. The limitation of abilities leads to player identity and a massive number of strategic possibilities. Strategic choices include Damage output and mitigation, Skill enhancements and debuffs, and Threat disabling and protection.
