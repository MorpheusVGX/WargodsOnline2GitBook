![](<../.gitbook/assets/Combat 4 (New UI and Shadows).png>)

The Combat system consists of two teams facing off until all players on one side are defeated. To achieve victory, players must outplay their opponents by strategically using their characters abilities and optimizing their use of Action Points. Players only control their character during combat even when using Mercenaries.
