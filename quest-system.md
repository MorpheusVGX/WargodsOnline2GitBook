Legend Cards provide the main engine for character advancement. Starting out each player is presented with a box of random cards. A legend card consists of a character from the original Wargods Online along with their bio and accomplishments, a challenge for the player to complete, and rewards for each challenge. When a legend cardâ€™s challenge is complete it can be turned into a merchant for the reward. Completed cards can then be combined to upgrade them to the next level to unlock more challenges.

* Rank I - 1 Card
* Rank II - 2 Completed Rank I cards
* Rank III - 2 Completed Rank II cards required
* Rank IV - 2 Completed Rank III cards required
* Rank V - 2 Completed Rank IV cards required

48 legend cards are available in the first set. This gives a total of 240 challenges to complete all Rank V cards. Cards can be directly bought and sold through local merchants. There are 3 types of quests that players can complete for rewards: Lore, Champion, and Training.
